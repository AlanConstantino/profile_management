# profile_management
A profile management system for Windows and Linux/Mac.

## Background

There isn’t a one–magic–solution, but the “best” approach that many have found is to build (or adapt) a manifest–driven system that uses your manifest as the single source of truth and then leverages a version control system (VCS) for backup and profile management. In practice, this means:

1. **Creating a Manifest File:**  
   Use a simple, human–readable file (for example, in YAML or JSON) that lists every file or repository you want to track. For each entry you might include:
   - The source file/directory path.
   - Any extra metadata (such as whether it’s already under version control).
   - Which profile(s) it belongs to.

2. **Backing Up with Version Control:**  
   Even if some of your files are not “source code”, you can still use a VCS (like Git) to track them. There are a couple of strategies here:
   - **Unified Repository with Submodules:** Put all your files (and repositories) into one “backup” repository. For files that are already under version control elsewhere, you can either leave them as is or add them as submodules.
   - **Separate Repositories:** For non–version–controlled files, have your tool copy or “import” them into a dedicated repository for backup.
   
   The key idea is that every time you make a change, your tool checks the manifest, gathers the files, and commits a snapshot.

3. **Supporting Multiple Profiles:**  
   The requirement that “switching profiles” shouldn’t lose changes is typically solved by having independent sets of tracked files. Common methods include:
   - **Branching:** Use one branch per profile. When you “switch” profiles, you check out the branch corresponding to that profile. Since each branch has its own commits, any changes made in one branch will be preserved when you switch away.
   - **Separate Directories/Worktrees:** Alternatively, you might use a tool like Git’s worktree feature or simply keep separate directories for each profile. Your manifest tells your tool where to “deploy” the files for the active profile.
   
   Either way, the manifest is used to know what files belong to what profile and a script or tool then “loads” (or deploys) that set. Changes in one profile are committed to its own branch/directory, so when you switch back the modifications are still there.

4. **Implementing the System:**  
   You can either write your own small command–line tool (in Python, Bash, etc.) that:
   - Reads the manifest.
   - Copies or symlinks files to a working location.
   - Commits any changes to the backup repository.
   - Switches between profiles (using branch switching, worktrees, or different directories).  
     
   Or, you can adapt an existing dotfiles management tool. Tools such as [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) or [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) use manifest files to manage your configuration files. Although they are designed for dotfiles, they can easily be adapted to track arbitrary files and even support multiple “profiles” or sets.

### In Summary

The “best way” to solve your problem is to combine a simple manifest file with a VCS–backed deployment/back–up system that supports multiple profiles. This might look like:

- A manifest (YAML/JSON) listing all files/repositories and their associated profiles.
- A tool that, when invoked, reads the manifest, copies/symlinks files into place, and commits any changes (using Git, for example).
- A profile–switching mechanism (via Git branches, worktrees, or separate directories) so that each profile’s state is independent and switching does not lose uncommitted changes.

This approach gives you a unified, versioned backup for everything you need to track, and lets users load different profiles without fear of losing their changes.
